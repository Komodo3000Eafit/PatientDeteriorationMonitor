# Project Status

> **Read this first.** This file tells you where the project is right now and what comes next.
> Whoever completes a step updates this file **in the same pull request** as the work.

**Last updated:** 2026-11-13
**Current phase:** 1 — Spec Kit and team setup
**Current step:** Step 11 — Technical stories: TS-01 ✅, TS-02 ✅, TS-03 ✅
**Next step:** TS-04 — React app skeleton (see [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md))

> **Where we left off (2026-11-13):** TS-01 and TS-02 merged to `main`. TS-03 is implemented on branch `003-db-tables-migrations`: the five tables (`users`, `patients`, `vital_signs`, `triage_events`, `alerts`) are defined in `backend/app/models.py` and versioned with Alembic (D-32). **The migration was applied to the Neon database (`neondb`) and verified**: it is at `0001_initial_schema (head)`, a second upgrade changes nothing, invalid rows are rejected, and downgrade + upgrade work. To resume:
> 1. **TS-03 is done:** merge its PR (paste the local pytest output and the manual Neon outputs, D-27). Each teammate runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` again, and nothing else: the shared Neon database is already migrated. Schema commands are in [backend/README.md](../backend/README.md#database-migrations).
> 2. From an up-to-date `main`, run `/speckit-specify` for TS-04 (React app skeleton), then `/speckit-clarify`.
> 3. Continue as before: plan → tasks → analyze → `claude --agent orchestrator` → review → PR (paste local pytest output, D-27) → merge.
> 4. Deferred to TS-09 (from the TS-02 and TS-03 security reviews): lock the indirect dependencies (including Mako and MarkupSafe) and run the vulnerability scan; optionally move pytest/httpx to a dev requirements file.
> 5. Notes for later stories (TS-03 security review): **TS-08** and the API stories must keep patient and user text fields synthetic (e.g. check the `PAT-NNN` identifier pattern); **TS-10** must never run `alembic downgrade` in CI/CD; and don't point frequent health probes at `/health` (D-30).
**Delivery deadline:** 2026-11-24 18:00 (see [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md))

> **Solo dry run:** one member is building the project end to end first, to learn the process and prepare resources. The project will then be redone with the full team using these docs.

## Roadmap

Legend: ✅ done · 🔄 in progress · ⏭ next · ⬜ pending

### Phase 0 — Local environment (done once per computer; each teammate follows [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md))

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Install Python 3.13 and Git | ✅ | Python 3.15 breaks the Spec Kit install on Windows (see DECISIONS D-02) |
| 2 | Install uv and Specify CLI v1.3.3 | ✅ | `--python 3.13` flag if 3.15 is present |
| 3 | Run `specify check` | ✅ | |
| 4 | Install Claude Code and log in | ✅ | |

### Phase 1 — Spec Kit and team setup (done once for the repository)

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Initialize Spec Kit: `specify init --here --integration claude --script ps` | ✅ | Committed to `main` |
| 6 | Commit Spec Kit setup (`.specify/`, `.claude/skills/`) | ✅ | |
| 7 | Project context docs (this file, DECISIONS, ASSIGNMENT, agents, DEVELOPMENT, CLAUDE.md) | ✅ | Updated: Claude-only agents (D-15) |
| 8 | Project constitution (`/speckit-constitution`) | ✅ | v1.1.0 in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (D-19, D-26). Draft by one member, pending team review (D-14) |
| 9 | Create the agent team files in `.claude/agents/` + agent activity log | ✅ | 6 agents (see [agents.md](agents.md)); CSV activity log per story via `scripts/log-agent.ps1` (D-22) |
| 10 | Align Spec Kit templates with the constitution, then write the backlog | ✅ | Templates: D-24. Backlog: [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) — 11 TS + 10 US (D-25) |

### Phase 2 — Baseline implementation (one Spec Kit feature per user story)

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | Technical stories TS-01 to TS-11: backend, Neon, tables, frontend, i18n, auth, scoring module, simulator, CI, Azure deployments | 🔄 | Foundation for every functional story. TS-01 ✅ (FastAPI skeleton). TS-02 ✅ (Neon database connection). TS-03 ✅ (tables + Alembic migrations, applied to Neon). Next: TS-04 (React app skeleton) |
| 12 | Functional baseline stories US-01 to US-05 | ⬜ | Implemented by one member; US-06 to US-10 are built by the team in the final session |

### Phase 3 — Delivery and demo

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Evidence: tests, security controls, agent activity log, deployed URL | ⬜ | |
| 14 | Each member rehearses building a story live from their own computer | ⬜ | 5–10 min per story |
| 15 | Submit deliverables | ⬜ | Deadline 2026-11-24 18:00 |

## Team onboarding checklist (each member)

- [ ] Get a Claude plan that includes Claude Code (needed to run the agents)
- [ ] Complete Phase 0 following [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [ ] Clone the repo and confirm `/speckit` commands appear in Claude Code

---

## Open questions / pending decisions

- Final triage scheme: NEWS2 for now; may be replaced by the official Colombian triage regulation (see DECISIONS D-08).
- Public dataset to use for vital signs (or synthetic data).
- Solo dry run: the "teammate review before merge" rule (constitution, workflow step 7) is self-reviewed until the team joins.
- Agent team composition may still change (see [agents.md](agents.md)).
- GitHub Copilot as a second AI tool: on hold (D-15); can be reconsidered if a license becomes available.
